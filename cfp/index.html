      <p>The Call for Participation will open later in the year.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What are we looking for?</h2>
<p>When the CFP opens, we'll be looking for proposals for talks, workshops, posters, and other events.</p>
<p>To get an idea of the kind of topics we're interested in,
take a look at <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/programme/">last year's programme</a>.
However, we're always open to new ideas.
The more varied the programme, the better!</p>
<h3>Talks</h3>
<p>Do you have something to share with the community?</p>
<p>Proposals on any subject are welcomed, at any level of technical expertise.</p>
<p>We want to hear about your experiments, discoveries, solutions, achievements, failures, and other adventures.</p>
<p>We want talks about "getting started with X", "how we used Y", and "what I learned building Z".</p>
<p>We want to you to teach us something, make us laugh, and broaden our horizons.</p>
<h3>Workshops</h3>
<p>Could you lead a tutorial on something related to the Python language or ecosytem?</p>
<p>We'll be holding workshops aimed at different levels of technical expertise.</p>
<h3>Posters</h3>
<p>Would you like to share your ideas with the community, but don't fancy getting on stage?</p>
<p>Poster sessions, held during lunch breaks,
give you the chance to present your work in a relaxed one-on-one setting.</p>
<h3>Other events</h3>
<p>What else would you like to see at PyCon UK?</p>
<p>Perhaps you'd like to run a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signing_party">key-sigining party</a>,
offer job interview practice,
or give a performance of your latest algorithmically-generated musical composition.</p>
<p>We're open to all kinds of ideas!</p>
<h2>Who do we want to hear from?</h2>
<p>This is a community conference.
You're coming to the event,
and that makes you part of the community and so that makes this your conference.
In other words, we want to hear from you.</p>
<p>We especially want to hear from first-time speakers.
If you haven't spoken at a conference before,
this is your invitation to do so.
You'll find that the PyCon UK audience is friendly and receptive!</p>
<h2>Financial support for speakers</h2>
<p>Grants to assist speakers on low budgets will be available,
as well as free and discounted tickets.
They'll be allocated by the committee.
<em>Any speaker who needs help will receive it.</em>
Financial assistance applications close when the CFP closes.</p>
