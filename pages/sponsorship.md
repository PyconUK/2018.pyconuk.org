Sponsorship
---

Sponsoring PyCon UK is a great way for your company to support the Python community,
promote your products,
and meet Python developers who are looking for work.

We couldn't run the conference without the generous support of our sponsors.
In return, we will ensure that your company is given exposure before, during, and after the conference,
and we will work with you so that you get exactly you're looking for out of sponsoring the conference.


## Benefits

We offer free tickets to all sponsors.

We will promote sponsors before the conference through social media and in the [UK Python News](http://uk.python.org/) newsletter.
In addition, your logo will be placed on the conference website and on signs around the conference venue,
and you will be able to advertise in the conference booklet.

Your company will be able to set up a booth in the central [Marble Hall](http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/rooms/marble-hall)
to allow you to interact with attendees for the duration of the conference.

We run a jobs fair over the Sunday lunchtime,
allowing sponsors to meet with conference attendees who are (or expect to be soon) looking for work.

In addition, if you are a gold or silver sponsor,
you will be offered time in the programme to give a presentation on an appropriate topic of your choice.
